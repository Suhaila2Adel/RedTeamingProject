# RedTeamingProject
#Red Team Operations ‚Äì Simulated Cyber Attack on "Morning Catch"
#üîç Overview
#This project simulates a comprehensive red team engagement against a controlled environment provided by the fictional organization Morning Catch. The operation followed a full attack lifecycle inspired by the Cyber Kill Chain model, revealing multiple security vulnerabilities including weak credential practices, lack of network segmentation, vulnerable services, and poor log management.
#
#The simulated adversarial engagement demonstrates real-world attack techniques including OSINT, phishing, reverse shell payload deployment, privilege escalation, persistent access establishment, and log obfuscation‚Äîexecuted ethically and within a scoped, pre-authorized testbed.
#
#Methodology
#The operation followed the Cyber Kill Chain methodology:
#
#1. Reconnaissance
#Passive: OSINT on employees, domains, technologies.
#
#Active: Nmap scanning, SMTP/HTTP enumeration, directory brute-force, employee photo harvesting.
#
#2. Weaponization
#Created reverse shell payload using msfvenom.
#
#Disguised as securityPatch.exe.
#
#3. Delivery
#Crafted phishing email via vulnerable SMTP.
#
#Payload hosted via http.server.
#
#4. Exploitation
#Phishing email deceived CEO.
#
#Execution of securityPatch.exe established reverse shell.
#
#5. Installation (Persistence)
#Created scheduled task (failed).
#
#Achieved persistence via RDP, user creation, and crontab manipulation.
#
#Applied chattr +i to prevent user removal or file modifications.
#
#6. Obfuscation / Anti-forensics
#Used shred to delete logs: /var/log/syslog, /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/xrdp.log.
#
#Key Findings
#Issue	Description
#Vulnerable Services	Outdated Sendmail 8.14.3
#Weak Credentials	Exposed employee directory with default credentials
#No Network Segmentation	Enabled lateral movement
#Social Engineering	CEO successfully phished
#Insecure Web Directories	Exposed user photos publicly
#Weak Persistence Controls	Achieved root access with resilient persistence
#Poor Logging Practices	Logs were deleted without detection
#
#Recommendations
#Critical
#Monitor and restrict cron/schtasks
#
#Lock down scheduled tasks creation
#
#High
#Centralize logs and monitor deletions
#
#Deploy File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
#
#Audit sudoers and restrict root delegation
#
#Medium
#Monitor access to sensitive files like /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
#
#Low
#Disable directory listing and restrict web directories
